It features GSAP animations, the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library, and Bootstrap for styling. Additionally, an admin panel allows for managing car listings and contact data.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: The backbone of the application, handling routing and server-side logic.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the frontend interface.

- **Frontend Animations**: Smooth animations powered by GSAP.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Implemented with the AOS library.
- **Admin Panel**: 
  - Manage car listings (add, edit, delete).
  - Admin can manage contact data.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled components using Bootstrap (currently not fully responsive).
